## Live Handwritten Determinant Solver

A project done within Soft Computing course at Faculty of Techincal Sciences, University of Novi Sad

The idea was to make a simple determinant solver that would solve the determinant from the input camera image in real-time.

After preprocessing of the image, a simple two-layered neural network is used for recognision of numbers. MNIST dataset is used as training set for the network.

Here is the example of input to output screen:
